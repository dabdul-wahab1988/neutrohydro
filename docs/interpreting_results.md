# Interpreting Results

## Understanding the Outputs

### 1. Mineral Fractions
These represent the relative contribution of each mineral to the total dissolved solids (TDS) of the sample.
- **Sum to 1**: The fractions are normalized.
- **Interpretation**: A high "Calcite" fraction indicates carbonate weathering is the dominant process.

### 2. Quality Flags
- **Exceedances**: Lists parameters that violate WHO guidelines.
- **Inferred Sources**: Suggests potential origins (e.g., "Saline Intrusion", "Agricultural").

### 3. Simpson's Ratio
- **Standard Ratio**: Indicates severity of salinity.
- **Inverse Ratio**: Distinguishes mechanism (Recharge vs. Intrusion).
    - **> 1**: Recharge (Fresh)
    - **< 0.5**: Intrusion (Seawater)

### 4. VIP Scores (Variable Importance)
- **T-VIP**: Importance of the baseline trend (Mixing).
- **F-VIP**: Importance of perturbations (Pollution/Exchange).
